blink(1)  
========

"blink(1) is a super status light: it packs three dimensions of information 
(color, brightness and pattern) into a single tiny package that fits into 
any USB port on nearly every device. It makes it incredibly easy to connect 
any data source in the cloud or on your computer to a full-color RGB LED so 
you can know what's happening without checking any windows, going to any 
websites or typing any commands."

The official repository of blink(1) software is:
    https://github.com/thingm/blink1/

That repo pulls from the active development repo:
   https://github.com/todbot/blink1/

Please submit any issues or pull-requests there.

Official releases of pre-built software are available at:

Ready-to-run Applications to play with
---------------------------------------

### Blink1Control ###

Blink1Control is a GUI application for hooking events to blink(1)
and is the primary user-level application for controlling blink(1).
It is an event-based system for triggering blink(1) color patterns.
Those events can be on your computer or on the Net.

Blin1kControl can receive events from:
- [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/channels)'s many channels
- IMAP/POP/GMAIL email services
- URLs containing text or JSON
- Local files or executed scripts 
- Hardware monitors like CPU, battery, RAM

This verison of Blink1Control supercedes the Mac-specific and Windows-specific
versions in the "mac" and "win" directories.

- **Download Blink1Control** 
   - Mac OS X: [Blink1Control-mac.zip](https://github.com/todbot/blink1/releases)
   - Windows:  [Blink1Control-win.zip](https://github.com/todbot/blink1/releases)

- Previous versions of Blink1Control written in Cocoa or .NET (not recommended) -
